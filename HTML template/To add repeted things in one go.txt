somethings in the websites remain constant overall for example the header and the footer
so instead of repeating them again and angin we can take the help of ejs to create templates
and include them in our project using the command called 

<%- include("header") -%>

and these are stored in a folder called views and file name called header.ejs and footer.ejs
